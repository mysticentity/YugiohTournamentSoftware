1. Here is how the program works, you will enter each user you wish to add to the tournament one by one. 
2. Once they've been added and you're ready to start you simply hit Start tournament.
3. Next you can individually click on a table and select a person to be the winner or whether they tied and whether or not one of those players is dropping, Select submit match.
4. Once you have done this for each table you can now hit submit round results and it will automatically take you to the next round.
5. Once you have gone through all of the rounds it will tell you that the tournament is not finished and then you may click on the button to view standings.

I'm not entirely sure how well going back to a prior round and changing match results work but that is in fact implemented.
you can also add a person mid round and they will automatically receive the round one loss.

This program should properly be using economies official way of doing tiebreakers. 

Thanks for checking out.
