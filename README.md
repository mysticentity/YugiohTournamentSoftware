This is a work in progress, expect more updates in the future. extract all contents of the zip file and run .exe file to start.
Pictures may be a bit outdated and all of the options have been moved to submenu's of the toolbar. 



1. Here is how the program works: you will enter each user you wish to add to the tournament one by one. 
2. Once they've been added and you're ready to start, you simply hit Start tournament from the options menu.
3. Next you can individually click on a table and select who is the winner or whether they both tied and whether or not one of those players is dropping.
4. Once you have done this for each table you can now hit submit round results which is also under options and it will automatically pair the next round.
5. Once you have gone through all of the rounds it will tell you when the tournament is now finished and then you can click view standings to see them which is also under options.

I'm not entirely sure how well going back to a prior round and changing match results work but that is in fact implemented and should be done at the start of a round.
you can also add a person mid round and they will automatically receive a round one loss.

This program should properly be using konami' official way of doing tiebreakers and calculations. the sole reason I worked on it.

Thanks for checking this out.
